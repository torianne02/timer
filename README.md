# Countdown Timer

## Introduction
Welcome to *Countdown Timer*, a React web-application that allows a user to enter a time (in minutes) as well as start, pause, resume, speed up, and slow down the timer. 

The text "More than half way there!" will appear when more than half of the allotted time has elapsed. The countdown text (HH:MM) changes to the color red when the countdown is under 20 seconds and will blink under 10 seconds. When the timer has hit 00:00 the text "Times up!" will appear.

Clone repository `$ git clone git@github.com:torianne02/timer.git`

Then, run the following:
``` javascript
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
